# Finished

This is how the app looks when everything is finished!

To build everything, `cd` into the `finished/` directory and run:

```shell
elm-live src/Main.elm --output=../server/public/elm.js --dir=../server/public --pushstate
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
