Getting Started
===============

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) 7.0.0 or higher

2. Clone this repository

Run this at the terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-0.19-workshop.git
cd elm-workshop
```

3. Start the server

We'll be running a local server for our Elm UI to use. Let's get it set up.

```shell
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

If the server started up successfully, you should see
`> moleculer-runner services` at the end of your terminal.

We're going to leave this server running and not touch it again for the duration
of the workshop, so **don't close it** until the workshop is over!

## Build the Elm UI

Leave the existing terminal running, and open a **second** terminal.

In the new termnal, `cd` into the `elm-workshop/server/` directory again.

Then run this to build the Elm code for the first time:

```shell
elm make src/Main.elm --output=../server/public/elm.js
```

If things arenâ€™t working, the instructor will be happy to help!
