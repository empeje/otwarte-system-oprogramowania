I never learn philosophy and ethics formally in the University, but ethical questions always annoy me and often I explore books, surf in the internet or any other activities to finish my quest to answer that questions. This post will somewhat related to my [unfinished post about Go-Jek and Grab](https://mappuji.org/blog/2018/01/28/my-little-investigation-of-grab-and-gojek/) and also my little project about [learning stoicism](https://mappuji.org/blog/2018/03/08/project-1-reading-and-researching-fundamentals-concepts-of-life-with-books-and-courses/). Recently, I annoyed by a question about what kind of relationship between ride-hailing company, driver and customers should be in context of Indonesia where we have not only car but also motorcycle as the kind of vehicle shared? And what kind of regulation the government should create in order to make the relationship balance. My inquiry still not finished, it is just snapshot about how I connect the letter one and two in Tao of Seneca to this problem.

If you're Indonesian or can read Bahasa you can open [this article about online ride-sharing](https://theconversation.com/cerita-pengemudi-menguak-eksploitasi-di-gojek-grab-dan-uber-84599). The article is somewhat not balance exploring the good and bad side of the ride-sharing, it more in the bad side, but the discussion in the comment is fairly balance and you can gain some insights there. One important point discussed in that article is about how much the driver (both car and motorcycle) can get from this kind of partnership work as a driver in Indonesia. Some driver who claim that they are an online driver they can get 6-9 million rupiahs which is more than Jakarta's minimum wage which is Rp. 3,355,750 [as per 2017](https://blog.talenta.co/uncategorized/daftar-upah-minimum-regional-tahun-2017-di-34-provinsi/). Some people agree with this, some people agree but with a note that to reach that point one should work more than 8 hours per day, more than 40 hours per week. Some people said that the number above is more like a maximum than an average, not every driver got that much especially if he is a motorcycle driver. Some people said it is a matter of diligent and tactics about where driver should wait for passengers. One people also very thankful for this kind of opportunity as driver partner for ride-sharing company.

This is the comment that very surprised me that comes from Go-Jek's driver

> Saya Denny dan saya Mitra GO-JEK . Alhamdulillah segala pujian Hanya Kepunyaan  Alloh, kemudian saya sangat berterima kasih kepada Bpk. Nadim  dan Team managemen  GO-JEK. Saya bangga menjadi mitra Gojek,,di saat semua perusahaan yg saya lamar menolak saya, Gojek mau menerima saya diusia saya yg 40 tn ini. Sekarang saya bisa mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga saya dengan 3 org anak, bisa bayar kontrakan, bisa punya motor walau dengan kredit. Alhamdulillah. Saya tidak rela jka ada oknum atw segelintir orang yg berusaha menjelek jelekan GO-JEK, pengetahuannya tentang ojek online dangkak tapi bicara terlalu banyak. Bp NADIM serta jajarannya lah yg lebih PANTAS DISEBUT WAKILNYA “ WONG CILIK ” spt saya dan mitra GO-JEK lainnya yg tinggal di kontrakan² kecil, gang gang sempit. Sekali lg terimakasih pak NADIM MAKARIM & TEAM MANAGEMENT GO-JEK yg sangat saya CINTAI DAN HORMATI,,,,BRAVO..GOJEK. - [Denny Setiawan](https://theconversation.com/profiles/denny-setiawan-411455)

he said that the opportunity to partner with Go-Jek is a life changing experience and he is very thankful to God and Nadiem Makarim and Go-Jek's management. And he proud to be a Go-Jek's partner. This is reminds me with some lessons I learn from [Tao of Seneca](https://tim.blog/2017/07/06/tao-of-seneca/).

> I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. - Letter 1: On Saving Time

> He says: “Contented poverty is an honourable estate.” Indeed, if it be contented, it is not poverty at all. It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor. What does it matter how much a man has laid up in his safe, or in his warehouse, how large are his  flocks and how fat his dividends, if he covets his neighbour’s property, and reckons, not his past gains, but his hopes of gains to come? Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough. Farewell. - Letter 2: On Discursiveness in Reading

I do believe, in any kind of work there is always ups and downs. Life is not always black and white, there is something in the middle. I also do believe there is always a way for people who want to work and grateful to what they have. As Seneca don't regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him.
