I am a super introvert person, sometime can't articulate my feeling, opinion or worry to people around me properly. Sometimes I so nervous an my mouth can't function properly to speak. Unfortunately, mu writing is not good either, just little better than my speaking.

As an introvert, I learn something today. Several days ago, my friend who just moved to Jakarta ask in group of friends (in WhatsApp) about who are now living here. I one of them. He is a warm man who love to connect to friends where ever he stay. Unlike me who very selfish from this point-of-view. I guess after knowing who are living here, they will contact them one by one, and true, when I met him Today, he can tell much about friends who living here.

But, I don't want to discuss about him. I want to discuss about something I learn from what he did. Today in the morning he ping me on WhatsApp about whether I'm free or not Today. Of course, I'm free, what I am doing is only doing code, learning Mandarin and procrastinating my self by watching YouTube, what a life? Actually because Today is sunny Sunday, I plan to go somewhere here to refresh my brain who full of problem whether it is at work or in my own brain.

And what makes me surprise is he told me that one of our friend hospitalized for dengue fever. I told him, yes I'm free, I just plan to go somewhere today alone, and it is better to visit our friend in hospital instead.

And we promise to meet at 1 P.M. in train station nearby to meet and go to the hospital together. We met our friend and his mother. After I arrive at the hospital I realized something. It is what it means when you say "please keep in touch" to friends in a farewell like when you graduate from university. It means when you know you move or visit place where there is your friends there you tell them you were there and is it possible to meet. Of course, you also need to spare time, if you are busy and can't allocate time, just say "hey, how are you doing? I'm visiting Jakarta. You're there too, right? I am stay here from 1 day, can't meet you hope you're doing well.". This way you can start a better conversation with your friends and your friendship bond is becoming better and better. And if happens that your friend visiting your city you can also say hi to them because we don't know if our friends are sick, or in a problem or anything. In this manner we can have a meaningful conversation and the best part, not missing our friends.
