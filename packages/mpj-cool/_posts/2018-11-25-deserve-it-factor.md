When I was in college, I know that I'm not dumb, but I'm not among the star when it comes to academic score. It is because I love trying new things, from joining student council, learn how robotic systems works, doing meaningful academic research, teach myself to teach high school and elementary school student and many others. I end up asking myself, If I'm not dumb, why I am not getting a very good academic score?

It wasn't clear at that time, but I believe if I give all my time to my academic life I'll get a lot of A in my academic report. Turned out it was right, I haven't reached 3.0 GPA from semester 1st to 6th, but in my 7th semester I got my GPA above 3 and move from an average student to an above average student in my class in term of the academic score. But I earned it at the cost of giving up my time to learn other stuff while I'm fixing my GPA. So it is a matter of trade-off, which one you want to maximize or double down? Long long after that, I learn a good quote from the best businessmen in the world, Charlie Munger and Jack Ma in their famous quotes.

> “To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people.” ― Charles T. Munger

>“I told my son: you don’t need to be in the top three in your class, being in the middle is fine, so long as your grades aren’t too bad. Only this kind of person [a middle-of-the-road student] has enough free time to learn other skills.” ― Jack Ma

Yeah, it turned out not being the brightest in school is not that bad, I learn a lot of skills while in organization learning how people do politics in the organization, how to treat people while you lead them in the team and how to inspire others. And more importantly I made a good friendship with my best friends, I will never be more grateful about that. Yeah, I learn that I get what I deserve.

In the next 5 years, I want to increase my “deserve it” factor and encourage people to do the same. Increase the “deserve it” factor in any area relevant to my dream, and for you in your dream. I believe what Charlie Munger said in another quote.

>“Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Day by day, and at the end of the day-if you live long enough-like most people, you will get out of life what you deserve.” ― Charles T. Munger

If the self-made billionaire and a very wise man like him say so, I'll definitely love to do it and make it part of my instinctual changes. Like Dalai Lama said in his quote.

>“Hearing, comprehending, make instinctual change” ― Dalai Lama

Let's have a better Monday! *With a tap dance if you like*.
