The place where God's plan anything else. Today I go home early from work to directly catch buss to go to place hundreds kilometers away from Jakarta with my friend, Purwokerto city.  We promise to meet at the train station nearby our office (we work in different company), the Sudirman Station. The schedule of the buss is 5 PM. I plan to go 3.40 and expected to arrive at train station at 4 PM to ride electric train to go to the buss pool in the nearest station. We met in the station, but it turned out that the train arrived at 4.30 PM and we have only 30 minutes to arrive at the nearest station then go to the buss pool 1km away from our target station. It turned out that we arrive at 5.00 PM at the target station and have only small window before the buss will go. We arrive at 5.10 at the buss pool riding a taxi from nearest station. However there is no buss there. Fortunately  and unfortunately, the buss is late. And it is expected to arrive at 5.30 based on realtime GPS due to traffic jam. One good thing,  we can catch the buss. But there is another good thing.  

I can't control myself to directly go to the toilet when my friend ask for the tickets. Then after (sorry) took a pee I just remember that I haven't done Ashar prayer (we moslem pray 5 times a day). It is one hour more before the next prayer time. This another good thing, I can finish my Ashar prayer and freed from obligation to do it in the buss (if needed we can do it in car or any transportation as long as we intend to allocate time and focus to pray). However the good thing is not finished. 

After several hours in the road,  finally at 10 we take a rest in buss stop restaurant. We have meal tickets as part of the facility and can take buffet meals. The meal was good. We also do Maghrib and Ishaa prayer before taking meal. However after we finished the meal and sit in our seats. Our buss got flat tire. In the left rear of the buss. Then I unconsciously said "Someone must be haven't done prayer yet, so God give them time.". I half joking when saying that, but it turns out that after the driver and couple of buss staffs fixed the tire and then driver turn on the machine then we just know there is one people haven't finished the pray and still in the Musholla to pray. We wait for couple of minutes and the we finally ready to go. 

And then before I eat my last medicine for mt sore throat and sleep in my buss I thinking about my country and connect the dots between event I face today. I think here is Indonesia. The place where God's plan is more in reality than any plan created by people, but somehow His plan is unexpected and always good for us. Thanks Allah for giving me time to tap in my phone touch keyboard to share about this.

PS: I do believe that God's plan and will always happen, we just thought that our plan success, but without His permission, nothing possible. It seems that everything we got is the result of only our effort, but behind them there always God's plan and will. Please correct me if I am wrong.
