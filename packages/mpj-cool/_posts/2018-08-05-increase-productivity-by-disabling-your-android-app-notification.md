As someone who encourages people to increase their productivity, I always try to be productive myself. It is including how I interact with the phone. Now, I want to share with you how to increase your productivity by doing something with your Android smartphone. Well, it is called a smartphone, it is smart enough to make you distracted. One of the most annoying experiences I have is when I suddenly hear some tone comes from my un-silent-ed phone and I just realized that it was from one of the apps I installed on my phone. More frustratingly, this kind of notification sometimes not only triggered by one app, most of the app, I installed to have this kind of alert. So, I decided to turn it off.

Here is the guided step.

1. Open your application
2. Press the list button then one similar to â‰¡
3. Click the app of your choice, the setting window will open
4. Search for permission setting and click it
5. Turn off the notification
6. Repeat for all of your application you want to disable

{% include image.html img="prod1.png" alt="step1" caption="Step 1" %}
{% include image.html img="prod2.png" alt="step2" caption="Step 2" %}
{% include image.html img="prod3.png" alt="step3" caption="Step 3" %}
{% include image.html img="prod4.png" alt="step4" caption="Step 4" %}

Hope this little tips can increase your productivity.

*Notes: The app I choose here is only an example and it is only my arbitrary choice.*
