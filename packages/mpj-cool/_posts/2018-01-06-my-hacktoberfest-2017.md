### Intro

It was October 2017. I am already join Midtrans and voluntary work for an open source project called Open Learning Exchange where the name is also a non-profit organization where they initiate the project. In parallel, I was playing with Digital Ocean, an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) product where it makes software developer easily deploy their software. It was a good coincidence, who are developer who don't want a free T-Shirt and some open source sticker?

### The Rule

The rule of the game is very simple. An organization or any project owner can set a label called `Hacktoberfest` to some issue and it will automatically fetched by the Hacktoberfest system. Then, an individual can search by issue tag in github. As I remember we need to create at least 7 pull request in order to get a free shirt (CMIIW). So at that time we tag many of our repository in [github.com/open-learning-exchange](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange) and [github.com/ole-vi](https://github.com/ole-vi) organization namespace. I and some of my folks in OLE finished the challenge and got email for the shipment. Surprisingly, we got a stranger interested to our core project called [ole-vi/planet](https://github.com/ole-vi/planet).

He is a Kenyan guy with username [github.com/kigsmtua](https://github.com/kigsmtua). And there is more surprising things if we see the profile. If we see his profile in GitHub his bio said `eat hack sleep`.

Very surprising that this kind of event can brings us to connect to more people and collaborate together. This system is really-really good. If you ever read a book called Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. The author said that with only gossip, a community of homo sapiens can collaborate up to 150 people, but for a larger community we need more good system that works with how human cognitive ability to work (read the book if you want to know more ðŸ˜‰).

### The Prize Arrive

After I forget that I was joining the Hacktoberfes, the owner of my building where I rent a room (Ibu Kost) sent a message that there is a package for me. I was in my hometown hundreds KM away from capital city where I work (Jakarta). I guess it is Hacktoberfest stuff and right it was. I go back to Jakarta in Thursday night and the Ibu Kost home already closed and it is not so polite to knock the door and ask for my package at 10 PM. So after I sleep and work at Friday, in Friday after work I take my package and open the package.

I was surprise that the package was so light. Then I open the package and it contains T-Shirt, some stickers and a thank you card. It is not so bad, although the quality of the shirt is not as good as I expected, and also the quality of printing in shirt is so bad. However, I really love the sticker.

Here what inside the package.

And this is how I use the sticker.

Whit all the complication I really enjoy Hacktoberfest, hope this kind of activity more frequently organized. Thanks for GitHub and Digital Ocean for organizing this event ðŸ˜˜
