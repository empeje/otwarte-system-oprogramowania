## Introduction

Hello, my name is mpj, you are currently reading my first post on my software testing blog. Now I want to share some experience and insight about my first full-time job and it is as SDET. Yes! SDET ‚Äì Software Development Engineer in Test. My job search journey started right after successfully conducted my final thesis Defense of my bachelor degree around 1 month before I write this article. My thesis is one of the best project I‚Äôve ever done and it is written in English even my national language is not English and I discover a method to increase the efficiency of measuring Young‚Äôs modulus of wood with a nondestructive evaluation.

Okay, I have finished my final thesis defense, will be graduated in one month and ready to open the door for next phase of my life. At that time, I was a part-time software engineer for a software consulting company called Wonderlabs in Yogyakarta for 3 months researched and developed a back-end piece of several web apps. In parallel, I also interning remotely to a non-profit company in US called Open Learning Exchange where I learn automated testing there. I think I want to take a more ‚Äúserious‚Äù full time job in Jakarta (a capital city of Indonesia), and I want to be either a software engineer or data scientist. I also prefer Fintech company since I love the industry and want to learn more about our financial system works.

I am neither computer science graduate nor information technology, but I love computer since I was kid when my Father give me an old Pentium III CPU in 2007. Since that, I believe that computer would open the door for everyone, now computer powered machine is helping many aspects of our life with products like smartphone, self-driving car, and many other. When I am interning in Microsoft last year I realize that now software industry is one of the most impactful industry with 4 of 5 software-powered technology company i.e. Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook filled the list of the most valuable brand by Forbes in 2017 (see [here]( https://www.forbes.com/powerful-brands/list/#tab:rank)). I believe I can maximize my potential if I develop my career in Software Industry.

I see that there are two jobs which interests me. There are software engineer and data scientist. I began to apply for the following category and company

* E-commerce
    * Tokopedia
    * BukaLapak
    * Qlapa
* FinTech
    * Cermati
    * Midtrans
* Media
    * Kumparan

Long story short. From 9 positions, 8 of them bring me to interview. I am not attending all the interviews, I only attending 5 interviews, 2 accepted, 2 rejected and 1 bring me to final interviews, then I rejected 1 final interview and 3 other interviews. However, two company who give me the offer letter is the company who fit personality and they give me the job I want. I offered a Data Analytics Engineer and Software Development Engineer in Test positions in two different company. Although, I love both positions I choose to be a Software Development Engineer in Test because I believe that by being an engineer in test, I could learn a holistic point-of-view of the business and software I contribute to. By doing so, I can learn about software engineering practice as well as learning the business for preparing my future journey as an entrepreneur.

Now, my aim is being a testing expert in two years and want to learn as many knowledge as possible. My role model is James Bach of Satisfice.com and I aim to surpass him as a software testing expert üòÉ
