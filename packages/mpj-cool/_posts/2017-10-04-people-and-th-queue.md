Just come back from busy days for the last couple month and this is my new blog. Yeah! As a starter for my blog. I want to write about queue. Yesterday I bought a electricity plug terminal in one of the well known convenient store in Indonesia. The queue was not that long, I only wait for 3-4 people as I remember, but the service was very slow.

TOne of the problem is there is one customer who doing several transaction at a time. He is paying something and pay with debit card (which take more time) then he doesn't stop, after the first transaction he ask the cashier for other transaction. Now he bought cellular phone credit (in Bahasa Indonesia called "Pulsa"). At that time I was thinking that, would be more polite if we give chance to other customer than we go back to queue? I don't know, what I remember is in some talk/seminar I watched in YouTube, in order to have multiple question, I need to go back to queue after my first question, this way I give chance to other people to ask their question. Is it applicable or ethical in this case of queue in convenient store? I don't know. What do you think?
