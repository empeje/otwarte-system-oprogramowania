Finally, I can create another post on my blog after a very busy schedule for the last few months. I've been very busy helping my employer maintaining their disbursement system and also internal build and release infrastructure. It is because I'm a mix between software and system engineer and my employer allow me to do both at the same time. Enough about myself. Let's talk about some idea.

Let's start with a story. This year is Asian Games 2018 is hosted in my country, Indonesia. Although I'm not attending many of the event I take a look to some of them. One of them is e-sport games especially Clash Royal. It is a game I know like 3 years ago when my little brother like to play it. At that time I very skeptical about games. My last experience with games is bad, I very addicted to it. However, after got some idea from my mentor that sometimes we need a little bit of games, a little bit of art, a little bit of entertainment, etc just to make our life balance and not trapped by a narrow perspective.

I see Clash Royal as a good choice because it is a combination of strategy and non-deterministic game where there is a random initial condition for the position of our deck (it is a card game tho - a visualize card game).

After playing this for a while, I gut stock in some trophy level, the rank of the player is counted by how much trophy they have. If I win a game I got approximately +30 and if I lose I got -15, that the default for starter. For player in the high trophy it is might be +30/-30 or even harder. The important thing about this game is we are matched with a player in the same trophy level in the battle so the different in the player only the skills and the deck and card they arrange.

Sometime after I got many wins I got more loses. For example when I reach 800 trophy when I continue playing with player with 810 trophy for example, I got lose and sometimes when I try again I got more loses. This is something I called failure as a control. Because the game probably take some idea from the real life. We can think of life as it this

> Sometime we need to have a failure as a control to our self that in order to have a greater gain, we need to pour more effort.

Yeah, that's life if its so easy it must be dream.
