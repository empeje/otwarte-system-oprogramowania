Finally, I can stick my hand in my keyboard not for doing code, but for some reflective time with writing some of my thoughts. This time I want to talk about my simple experience. It is actually just happen some hours before I write this article.

Recently, I plan to reformat or reset my sleep pattern to be more organized and bring back my old habits to wake up early in the morning. In the last few months, wake up early is a very expensive yet meaningful moment I ever had. Actually I spend my time working and spend my spare time volunteering to small open source project. Mainly it is because passion, I spen so much time in the night to help my open source project better and often I also work overtime to fix somebug in code/script I wrote in my dayjob.

Enough for the background, lets talk about my experience that I want to share. Here is the story. At that day I go to office on time and go home on time (in Bahasa called "teng-go", teng is the sound and go for go). Together go home with my workmate then he stop earlier than me because his home is closer than I am. Then, I increase my speed to arrive to my home as early as possible since I haven't finish my Maghrib Prayer. Then, I was surprised that when a high school aged boy talk to his friend that it is very interesting to see the central electricity distribution post explode. What the hell? Is it power outage? I was planning to finish my homework in some MOOCs I enrolled. I never expect I got a power outage in the city where I live now. It is mainly because since my first time moving to this city (4 months ago), I never experienced power outage. Something simple that I never thought. I have no plan what to do if there is power outage, no internet, and no light. Afterall, I just then pray, go for some food, buy snack for my night activity (read: online course and/or reading). After I go back from eat and bought some snacks, it is still dark with no light in my home, I just lied in my bed and watching my weekly dose of my favorite Aniime, Boruto which already release their new episode yesterday. Fortunately, after 3/4 of duration of my favorite Anime, the lights on and I ready to work on my online course. Unfortunately, I felt asleep and lost 2 hours my productive hours.

*Lesson Learned* It is better to always have a plan B and C even for a small thing like lunch menu today, what to do after work, our work result, and etc. Lets always assume the worst and normally unexpected event happen. Expect for black swam event. Ability to adapt is the best. Then, don't forget to apply any knowledge we have as much as possible. That way, I believe I can be a better person as my favorite writer said 

>“An educated person must learn to act justly, beginning, first of all, with his thoughts, then later in his deeds. That is what it means to be educated.”
>— Pramoedya Ananta Toer

It is also applicable to my day job as a Software Development Engineer in Test. As a developer who use programming to conduct test, I must be aware of potentially normally unexpected thing would happen in any kind of situation I would aware off. Next time I will combine my biological neural network and machine learning (intuition) with rule base (knowledge) to adapt and prepare for normally unexpected things happen. Lets face a better day tomorrow!
