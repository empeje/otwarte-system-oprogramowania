Finally, I able to go back to chill on my bed with my laptop on and write blog or reading book or surf the internet freely. It is actually a draft created yesterday, and I forget to finish because I unintentionally sleep for waiting my wifi to turn on again after some network problem.

In this post I want to talk about something interesting in what we in Indonesia have with street food market. I am not a big city guy who prefer big merchant/restaurant or even well known fast food for eat. I prefer traditional or street food I can buy near where I live. Yesterday I bought a portion of duck gizzard with Indonesian tofu in a street food merchant near my house. It is very delicious, and every time I go there is always people buy it every time in their 4 seat size merchant.

At that time the merchant was only served by one waiter. I came and ordered and then wait. When my order arrived in the table then I start to eat, and because at that time the rate of customer ordering food is small, the waiter go to a small merchant to buy a glass of cold drink, eventually there is one customer arrive, and what surprise me is there is one other merchant selling chicken porridge near the merchant where the waiter buy a glass of cold drink called him and inform him that there is a new merchant want to order something. I really surprised that there is cooperative behaviour that one merchant support one another and not the opposite, at that time I learned that wherever we go, we need to be nice to every people, except that people doing something harmful or dangerous for us.

What surprise me the most is the immediate response of the neighboring merchant to call the waiter as soon as there is customer arrive. I may not do that if in his position. That kind of cooperation touch me so much and I think that if the attitude of mutual cooperation (in Bahasa gotong royong), if practiced in large scale would impact many aspect of life in society. I imagine a life where people cooperatively support each other and we'll have prosperous society. The society I am dreaming of.

It also bring me to other question. If we have so many good people in life is news in the television, internet media, and etc is only showing bad thing in life? Or I only live in a good side of the world?
