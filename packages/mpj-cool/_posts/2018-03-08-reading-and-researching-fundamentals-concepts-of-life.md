Recently after I enrolled the [Top Performer Course](http://top-performer-course.com). I was being annoyed with the idea of we need to invest on learning to right skills in order to gain the right result in our future life including career, our health, and many other aspects in life. The idea of investing our time, energy and money to the right kind of personal development seems obvious but it is kinda hard because when I try to break down my dream, the lifestyle I want to have in life and the kind of work I want to do, it seems I have so many dream and I only have limited time. This question disturb me for several days then today when I on sick leave I somewhat having the answers. It is about questioning ourself and actually do the stuffs to see whats works.

As I mentioned earlier, today I actually on a sick leave from work because of fever and headache that disturb me from work it feels hurt when I think, but somehow when I want to do some activities that make me less boring in my room beside watching YouTube, I am becoming interesting in asking myself what kind of life I want to have, what kind of person I want to be and create and action items to reach that goals.

>What kind of life do I want to have?

From many questions I've in mind one of the most interesting for me and it somewhat needs to solve earlier than any other question is about what kind of life do I want to have? Of course I want to have many kind of things from skills to make me financially independent and efficient, communication, until about having the right amount of entertainment in my life. I can't describe everything here, but as a follow up of my question to myself, I want to do a small project. I called it Project #1 where I want to read books about stoicism and some other relevant books. Since people that influenced my life is coming from that side of people from Tim Ferris, Cal Newport, Scott H. Young, and Dain Miller to name a few. I think they are somewhat related to stoicism (they practice that philosophy) and they are successful in their own meaning and highly respected.

So, this is the project I've write down in a piece of paper.

I'll be sharing my progress here and will update the result of my inquiry and the impact I gain in my life. So, stay tuned.
