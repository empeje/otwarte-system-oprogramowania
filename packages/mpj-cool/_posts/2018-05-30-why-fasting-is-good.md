Happy Holy Ramadan for all Moslem in the world. Yeah, this month the second half of May and first half of June is a Holy month of Ramadan. And like all the Moslem I do fasting. You might be wondering why all the Moslem do fasting in a full one month. I want to share something I learn from the first half of the Ramadan about fasting, so you might found the answer here.

### From outsider perspective

So let's start with Seneca. He writes in his famous letter something about festival and fasting. Although Seneca version of fasting and Syaria' version of fasting might be different, it is interesting to take some notes.

> I am so firmly determined, however, to test the constancy of your mind that, drawing from the teachings of great men, I shall give you also a lesson: Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: "Is this the condition that I feared?" -[Seneca](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_18)

Is this the condition that you feared? Yeah, for us who lived in the modern world and having a good income we might be able to afford good food in terms of quality and quantity. We might be missing the feeling of eating much food if we do fasting, but that's the point, is this condition that you feared? Just like why army train everyday while the world is still in peace. They prepare for the worst case. Prepare to make yourself ready for something we don't want to happen to happen.

If you think about the world today a food crisis and [energy crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_crisis) are something really happen in some places. Be ready. You might be eating some candy in the future and miss how delicious it is sushi or steak.

### From insider perspective

Like some of you, I love to eat. You may eat a lot, me too. However, if you try to do fasting, things might turn different. In Islam, we fasting from the dawn till sunset and before that, we have a little eating session before the dawn called Sahur. You know what, it might be hard when you reach something around 1 PM, but after that, you'll be used to it. And when the breakfast time comes, you'll be feeling full easily even though you're not eating that much food. And this is the magic. Sometimes you eat that much food that it is actually not necessary.

> And when the breakfast time comes, you'll be feeling full easily even though you're not eating that much food. And this is the magic. Sometimes you eat that much food that it is actually not necessary.

If we extrapolate a little bit, this pattern of having too much of something is happening in a different part of life. Too much game (if you're not a professional gamer), too much Netflix, too much procrastinate, etc. Sometimes need to pause and ask our self, is this the right things to do?

Now you can feel very fortunate, not many people able to eat 4 times a day, let a lone eat enough food a day. Not many people having a feeling of too much food in the stomach after eating too much food, some people might be the opposite, missing the feeling deliciousness of the good food.
