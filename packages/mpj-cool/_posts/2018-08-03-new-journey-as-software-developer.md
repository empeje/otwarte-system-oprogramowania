When I was a child I like to watch an anime series titled Digimon and I always excited with the boy using their laptop everywhere and typing with only one hand while the other hand hold the laptop and support it so that he can type. Honestly, I never succeed to type like that while standing and walking like I saw in the anime. Anyway, let's jump to the main topic.

Apparently, my idol when I was a child becomes my role model and shape me through my adulthood. I finished my bachelor degree in engineering physics and then instead of working in the process, energy, or manufacturing plant like most of my friends did, I took a path as a software engineer. I start my career as a software developer working in a small software shop based in Yogyakarta then not long after 4 months working there I'm not feeling good about the company and how they treat people. I decide to move, but now I work in a little bit less programming work involved. I applied as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) and accepted, here in a leading online payment gateway in Indonesia.

One year in this payment gateway company, I decided to ask for a new role as a developer. While when I working as an SDET I give a significant impact, I want more. When I was an SDET, I am not working like other QA (people like lumped together this role with QA) guy. I'm helping the team has a very good CI/CD setup and seamless ~automated~ testing experience. After one year, I want to achieve my true dream, dream write code that used by millions of people.

Surprisingly, my boss asks me not only development but also to overseas QA+Dev+Ops side of the team I work now. Now, I'm working on disbursement service where I helping the company to build dependable disbursement service to support e-commerce and FinTech industry here in Indonesia. I hope everything will be going well.
